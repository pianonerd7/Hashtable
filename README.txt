This program is a hash table that counts the frequency of a file. It prints out the word and the frequency on each line within a pair of parenthesis. 

To run the file, in the main method of the HashWordCount class, simply change the inputFileName and the outPutFileName to your desired file, but do make sure that your txt file is saved in the same folder as the code.

Rehashing is needed when lambda is more than 45%.

The average collision is the last line of the output file. 

The "toy" file that I tested is called "Test.txt", and the "toy" output is "Test". 

The actual file that I tested is called "Sherlock Holmes.txt" and the actual file is called "Sherlock is Awesome".
